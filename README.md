# About

This project focus on creating an object that is temperature to convert from,
with function constructor. and using prototype object property to add the method
to convert the temperature, so that all object instance can use the prototype
method.

# Review

Why do the function have a capital at their first letter that may indicate it's
a constructor. the project feel really rushed without that much a planning. i must
have been desperate to keep the github commit streak going on. no one care about
your github profile. this project also felt to similiar to past project. not really
pushing my boundary here. i need to spend more time on the planning and decide which
one should i practice on while making sure that the project not felt too easy nor too
hard. should be at the level where is it not too hard but still achievable through more
practice.
